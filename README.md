# Serverless Web Forum for Help Exchange

## Introduction
The spread of COVID-19 has made communities kick into high gear in preparation for supporting those most impacted by the virus. The goal of our web application is to provide a way for our local community members to request and provide support to each other. Some key features that our application provides are as follow:

Mutual Assistance Forum: As community members, we all have skills and resources to contribute to share with one another. Here is a platform for people to connect with each other and exchange, whether itâ€™s Food, Shelter, Medical Care, Utility Services, Child Care, Senior Care and More.

Community Resource Guide: There has been a lot of announcements and changes to regular services around the country. This guide tries to bring all of this news together into one place and be regularly updated. You will find info about services related to food, housing, child care, transportation, utilities, and more.

Group project from course "Cloud Computing". The goal of Fit-Tune is to improve user workout experience by providing real time smart music tempo and style adjustment based on sensor readings from your smart phone.
